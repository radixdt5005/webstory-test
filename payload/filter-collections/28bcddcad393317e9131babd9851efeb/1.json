{"items":[{"title":"Khushboo Gujarat Ki","content":"<p>Vibrant Gujarat stretches out into the Arabian Sea, with a hint of the desert and a coastline of 1600 km. It is  the home state of Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation. It is renowned for its beaches, temple towns and historic capitals. Wildlife sanctuaries, hill resorts and natural grandeur are gifts of Gujarat. Sculpture, handicrafts, arts, festivals also make the state rich. Gujarat is also among the most technologically advanced, housing the largest petrochemical complex in the country.</p><h2>Experiences In Gujarat</h2><h3>Kite Festival</h3><p>The International Kite Festival (Uttarayan) is regarded as one of the biggest festivals. Months before the festival, homes in Gujarat begin to manufacture kites.</p><p>During the festival, local food such as Undhiyu (a mixed vegetable including yam and beans), sesame seed brittle and jalebi is served to the crowds. Days before the festival, the market is filled with participants buying their supplies. In 2012, the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat mentioned that the International Kite Festival in Gujarat was attempting to enter the Guinness World Records book due to the participation of 42 countries in it that year. The best place to enjoy this festival is the Sabarmati Riverfront or the Ahmedabad Police Stadium, where people lie down to see the sky filled with thousands of kites.</p><h3>Navratri</h3><p>Navratri, meaning 'nine nights', is one of the most popular and widely celebrated Hindu festivals in many parts of India. Gujarat, however, is the only state that erupts into a nine-night dance festival, perhaps the longest in the world. Each night, all over the state, villages and cities alike, people gather in open spaces to celebrate feminine divinity, referred to as Shakti.</p><p>The dance form known as ras garba (also joined sometimes by dandiya, which uses small wooden sticks), comes from Lord Krishna's worship rather than Goddess worship, from the Gop culture of Saurashtra and Kutch.</p><h2>Things To Do In Gujarat</h2><ul><li>Cuisine</li><li>Tourist Attractions</li><li>Culture</li><li>Flora And Fauna</li></ul><h2>UNESCO World Heritage Sites</h2><h3>Rani Ki Vav, Patan</h3><p>The stepwell was built in 1063 by Rani Udayamati of the Chaulukya Dynasty to commemorate her husband, Bhimdev I. The stepwell was rediscovered in 1940s, and the Archeological Survey of India restored it in the 1980s.</p><h3>Champaner and Pavagadh Archaeological Park</h3><p>A UNESCO Heritage site, Champaner and Pavagadh, are often clubbed together as one of the most engaging historical attractions of Gujarat. The duo makes a rich heritage site dotted with forts, mosques, monuments, tombs, arches, temples, step-wells and fortresses from 8th to 14th centuries.</p><h3>Ahmedabad World Heritage City</h3><p>Situated in the heart of Gujarat, Ahmedabad has a character like no other, defined by a spirit of enterprise. Although Ahmedabad is a bustling metropolitan with reputed institutes and a rapidly growing economy, it is deeply rooted in tradition. The city is known for its association with Mahatma Gandhi, and in addition to a complex maze of neighborhood called pols, hosts some of the country’s finest medieval Islamic Architecture.</p><h2>Top Attractions &amp; Destinations In Gujarat</h2><h3>RannUtsav</h3><p>A plethora of varied hues, profusion of design, superfluity of culture, cornucopia of music and dance, all together in the arid lands of Kutch create a mosaic of exquisiteness, which reflects the identity and spirit of the region. Kutch, one of the most ecologically and ethnically diverse districts of the state is a celebratory land of art, crafts, music, dance, people, and nature. During the full moon night of winters, amid the awe-inspiring and contrasting landscape, each year a three-day festive extravaganza brimming with hospitality, vigor and traditional flavor of the area is hosted and known as the Kutch of Rannutsav.</p><h3>Sasan Gir</h3><p>This forested, hilly, 1412-sq-km sanctuary, about halfway between Veraval and Junagadh, is the last refuge of the Asiatic lion (Panthera leopersica). Taking a safari through the thick, undisturbed forests is a joy – even without the added excitement of spotting lions, other wildlife, and myriad bird species. Access to the sanctuary is by safari permit only, bookable in advance online.</p><h3>Statue Of Unity</h3><p>October 31st, 2018, marked the inauguration of the world’s tallest statue – the Statue of Unity, against the backdrop of the dramatic Satpura and Vindhyachal hills in Kevadia, Gujarat. The 182-metre (600 feet approx.) statue is dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the architect of independent India. The colossal monument towers over River Narmada, a tribute to India ‘from the people of Gujarat’ to the leader who placed people’s welfare first. The Statue of Unity overlooks a vast area, including the river basin of the Narmada and the sprawling Sardar Sarovar dam.</p>","slug":"/articles/gujarat","componentName":"article","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.833Z","image":{"name":"khushboo_gujarat_ki","alternativeText":"khushboo_gujarat_ki","caption":"khushboo_gujarat_ki","width":1397,"height":1079,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_khushboo_gujarat_ki","hash":"thumbnail_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":202,"height":156,"size":12.69,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_khushboo_gujarat_ki","hash":"small_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":386,"size":79.07,"url":"/uploads/small_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_khushboo_gujarat_ki","hash":"medium_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":579,"size":165.85,"url":"/uploads/medium_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_khushboo_gujarat_ki","hash":"large_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":772,"size":264.92,"url":"/uploads/large_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb.jpg"}},"hash":"khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":369.29,"url":"/uploads/khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.812Z"},"seo":{"title":"Khushboo Gujarat Ki","description":"Vibrant Gujarat stretches out into the Arabian Sea, with a hint of the desert and a coastline of 1600 km.","canonical":"/articles/gujarat","metaTags":[{"type":"Property","key":"og:title","value":"Khushboo Gujarat Ki"},{"type":"Property","key":"og:description","value":"Vibrant Gujarat stretches out into the Arabian Sea, with a hint of the desert and a coastline of 1600 km."}],"redirectRoutes":[]},"categories":[{"name":"Heritage","slug":"/categories/heritage","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.029Z"}],"author":{"name":"Jigar Verma","info":"Traveller","slug":"/authors/jigar-verma","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.201Z","picture":{"name":"jigarverma","alternativeText":"jigarverma","caption":"jigarverma","width":50,"height":50,"hash":"jigarverma_62c6b21c20","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":0.98,"url":"/uploads/jigarverma_62c6b21c20.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.159Z"}}},{"title":"Most Popular Heritage","content":"<p>Among the seven wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal, in Agra, is a delight to explore.

The first of the grand tombs synonymous with Mughal architecture, this monument narrates a timeless saga of love and longing. Built by Mughal emperor Humayun's first wife, empress Haji Begum, in her husband's memory, the tomb houses the graves of both the emperor and his wife and stands as a testament to their eternal love.</p><h2>Taj Mahal</h2><p>Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, the creator of the Taj Mahal, said that the beauty of the monument made “the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes”. It has also been described as a “teardrop on the cheek of eternity” by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Every year, thousands of tourists from around the world make a beeline for this breathtakingly ethereal marble monument, considerd by many as the most beautiful building constructed by man. The monument was built as a memorial by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his deceased wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is one of the seven wonders of the world and is a monument of pride for not just Agra but also India.</p><p>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is featured in almost all literature about India and is one of the most enduring images of the country. Its name is believed to have been drawn from the Persian language: ‘taj’ means crown and ‘mahal’ means palace, thus making this the palace of the crown. Interestingly, the queen it was built in memory of, originally named Arjumand Begum, held the name Mumtaz Mahal, which meant the crown of the palace. Although it is best known as a symbol of love, a grieving emperor’s ode to his deceased queen, another legend sees the Taj Mahal as an embodiment of Shah Jahan’s vision of kingship. The story goes that he sought to build something akin to heaven on earth, a spectacular, unbelievably beautiful monument that reinforced the power as well as the perceived divinity of the monarch as next only to the Almighty.</p><p>It is also widely believed that emperor Shah Jahan invited artisans from Italy and Persia to work on this marble monument. It is said that Ustad Ahmad Lahori was the chief of the project while Ustad Isa Afandi made the site plan. The calligraphic work has been credited to Amanat Ali Khan Shirazi. A fascinating aspect of this structure is that it looks the same from all four sides, except the one that faces River Yamuna. This side is said to have been especially embellished to serve as the main entrance for the emperor. Shah Jahan would approach the Taj Mahal from the river, aboard a barge, while the entrance used by tourists today served, at the time, as an entryway for soldiers and common people. There are intricate inscriptions on all four entrances, while marble carvings and pietra dura mosaics adorn the walls. Lapis-lazuli, cornelian, mother of pearl, agate and emerald are some of the precious gems and stones that were once used in its design. It is said that work on its construction began in 1631. Legend has it that it took 20 years to complete this architectural marvel!</p>","slug":"/articles/most-popular-hertitage","componentName":"article","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.392Z","image":{"name":"most_popular_heritage","alternativeText":"most_popular_heritage","caption":"most_popular_heritage","width":388,"height":300,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_most_popular_heritage","hash":"thumbnail_most_popular_heritage_2f0cbb2fe2","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":202,"height":156,"size":4.6,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_most_popular_heritage_2f0cbb2fe2.jpg"}},"hash":"most_popular_heritage_2f0cbb2fe2","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":11.68,"url":"/uploads/most_popular_heritage_2f0cbb2fe2.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.312Z"},"seo":{"title":"Most Popular Heritage","description":"Among the seven wonders of the world","canonical":"/articles/most-popular-hertitage","metaTags":[{"type":"Property","key":"og:title","value":"Most Popular Heritage"},{"type":"Property","key":"og:description","value":"Among the seven wonders of the world"}],"redirectRoutes":[]},"categories":[{"name":"Heritage","slug":"/categories/heritage","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.029Z"}],"author":{"name":"Deepika Mukherjee","info":"Traveller","slug":"/authors/deepika-mukherjee","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.233Z","picture":{"name":"deepikamukherjee","alternativeText":"deepikamukherjee","caption":"deepikamukherjee","width":50,"height":50,"hash":"deepikamukherjee_a29575b3c3","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":1,"url":"/uploads/deepikamukherjee_a29575b3c3.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.185Z"}}}],"totalCount":2}
