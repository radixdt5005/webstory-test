One of the char dhams, which are considered important pilgrimage destinations by Hindus, Kedarnath is said to be the abode of Lord Shiva, who is worshipped in the main shrine. Thousands of devotees from all over the country, undertake an arduous but devotional journey to reach this 3,584-m-high temple, which is the highest of the 12 jyotirlingas (devotional shrines of Lord Shiva) in India.</p><p>Crystal clear lakes, curative hot springs and colourful valley beds of rhododendrons, make Kedarnath a nature lover's delight. For those who want to hike their way into the heart of the Himalayas, there are trekking options galore. The most popular of these is the trek from the sacred Gaurikund to the temple and from the temple to the serene Vasuki Lake.</p><h2>Chorabari Tal</h2><p>The crystal-clear Chorabari Tal offers magnificent views of the surrounding Himalayan peaks. Also known as the Gandhi Sarovar or Gandhi Tal, the lake lies about 3 km from the Kedarnath temple. An easy trek from the temple leads you to the lake, which was originally known as Kanti Sarovar. In 1948, some of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were immersed in the lake after which it was renamed Gandhi Sarovar. Legend has it that it was at Chorabari Lake that Lord Shiva imparted the knowledge of yoga to the Saptrishis. Perched at an altitude of 3,900 m above sea level, the lake originates from the Chorabari Bamak Glacier. You can also visit the nearby Bhairava Temple. The mesmeric Madhu Ganga Waterfalls falling on the way makes for a serene stopover.</p><h2>Shankaracharya Samadhi</h2><p>Lying slightly behind the Kedarnath Temple is the grave of Adi guru Shankaracharya, the saint who is said to have established the four sacred dhams in India that are an important pilgrimage for Hindus. The famous Hindu philosopher had attained nirvana (enlightenment) at a young age of 32. It is said that Shakaracharya merged with the land itself. Visited by thousands of pilgrims, the Shankaracharya Samadhi is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Kedarnath. Legend has it that Shankaracharya came to Kedarnath in the 8th century and built the Kedarnath shrine and established one of his four mathas. A hot water spring believed to have been created by Shankaracharya is visited by his disciples to get relief from the extreme climatic conditions in the area.</p><h2>Gaurikund</h2><p>The hot water spring of Gaurikund is one of the holiest sites for Hindus, who come to take a dip in it. It is believed that taking a dip in the holy water of the pond will make a person pure. Surrounded by panoramic views, Gaurikund also serves as the starting point of the famous Kedarnath temple trek. The spring lies at a height of about 6,000 ft in the Garhwal Himalayas. Devotees also visit the Gauri Devi Temple dedicated to Goddess Parvati. It is believed that this was the site where Goddess Parvati had meditated for a long time to win Lord Shiva as her husband. The area is also associated with the legend of Lord Ganesha acquiring his elephant head.</p>","slug":"/articles/kedarnath","componentName":"article","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.576Z","image":{"name":"kedarnath","alternativeText":"kedarnath","caption":"kedarnath","width":388,"height":300,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_kedarnath","hash":"thumbnail_kedarnath_173aa0a061","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":202,"height":156,"size":10.62,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_kedarnath_173aa0a061.jpg"}},"hash":"kedarnath_173aa0a061","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":34.93,"url":"/uploads/kedarnath_173aa0a061.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.417Z"},"categories":[{"name":"Spiritual","slug":"/categories/spiritual","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.029Z"}],"author":{"name":"Priya Sharma","info":"Traveller","slug":"/authors/priya-Sharma","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.208Z","picture":{"name":"priyasharma","alternativeText":"priyasharma","caption":"priyasharma","width":50,"height":50,"hash":"priyasharma_b2f1d624f4","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":1,"url":"/uploads/priyasharma_b2f1d624f4.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.171Z"}}},"id":"0-article"}]},"masterPageSlots":{},"tags":{"title":"Kedarnath - Abode of Lord Shiva","canonical":"http://localhost:3000/articles/kedarnath","metaTag":{"property":{"og:title":"Kedarnath - Abode of Lord Shiva","og:description":"Ensconced in the snow-capped Garhwal Himalayas, surrounded by a lush cover of alpine meadows and brushed by the pristine and holy Mandakini river,"},"name":{"description":"Ensconced in the snow-capped Garhwal Himalayas, surrounded by a lush cover of alpine meadows and brushed by the pristine and holy Mandakini river,"}}}};
