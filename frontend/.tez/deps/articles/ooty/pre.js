Clear blue skies, lush green hills, deep verdant valleys and pleasant weather culminate to make this gem of the Nilgiris (Blue Mountains) one of the most attractive tourist destinations in South India. Peppered with coffee and tea plantations, forests of eucalyptus, conifers and pines, and a thick cover of shola trees, Ootacamund is the perfect getaway for nature lovers. Such is the renown of its beauty that it is popularly referred to as the 'Queen of Hill Stations' and the 'Switzerland of India'.</p><p>A popular summer retreat for Britishers, as well as the capital of the Madras residency in British India, Ootacamund or Ooty or Udhagamandalam (as it was earlier called) has been bestowed with many architectural wonders, thanks to its colonial heritage. The most prominent of these is the Raj Bhavan or the Government House, which is a cream-coloured sprawling bungalow, with a stunning ballroom. It was the erstwhile residence of the governor of Madras and draws tourists from around the area.<br>The best way to explore this quaint hill town is via the toy train, which runs on one of the steepest tracks in Asia. Going from a height of 1,069 ft to 7,228 ft, it winds through several breathtaking and picturesque spots, letting one drink in the spectacular size of the rocky terrain, ravines and lush green hills. Some of the scenic stops of this toy train include Coonoor, Wellington and Lovedale.<br>Ooty is predominantly inhabited by the Toda tribe, who have been calling the area their home since centuries.</p><h2>Ooty Lake</h2><p>The pride of Ootacamund, the artificial Ooty Lake is the centre of attraction in this part of the Nilgiris. A popular tourist recreational spot, this L-shaped lake provides boating facilities. You can sail a boat in the dazzling blue waters yourself or hire a boatman to row you through.

There are even green and black roses here! To captivate the senses, there is a viewpoint in the garden called Nila Maadam, from where one can get a breathtaking view of the entire landscape.</p><h2>Kalhatti Falls</h2><p>About 13 km away from Ootacamund lies the Kalahatti Village. After a two-mile trek from here, one can reach the magnificent Kalahatti Falls. The trek through the dense foliage is an adventure in itself. Before reaching the waterfall, one will have to cross a stone path and a bridge built during the colonial era. It is fabled that the waterfall site was once home to saint Agastya. The 100-ft-high waterfall houses a vast variety of flora on its land, making it a sight to behold.
