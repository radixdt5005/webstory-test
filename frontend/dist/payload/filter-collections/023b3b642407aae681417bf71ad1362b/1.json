{"items":[{"title":"The most popular attractions in Varanasi-new","content":"<h2>Vishwanath Mandir</h2><p>One of the most popular attractions in Varanasi, the Vishwanath Mandir, also known as Kashi Vishwanath Temple, is dedicated to Lord Shiva, the presiding god of the city. Also referred to as the golden temple, due to its gold-plating, this temple holds a very special place among Hindu devotees. Given its present shape in 1780 by queen Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore, the temple's iconic 15.5-metre-high gold spire and gold dome were donated by Ranjeet Singh, the ruler of Punjab in 1839. The temple is ensconced within a maze of other shrines and narrow galis or walkways lined by shops selling sweetmeats, paan (betel leaf), handicrafts and other knick-knacks. The time for darshan (general visit) is from 4 am to 11 pm. Adjacent to the temple are Annapurna Temple dedicated to the goddess of food and Dundiraj Vinayak dedicated to Lord Ganesha, which are equally revered. The temple is located on the banks of River Ganges and the jyotirlinga (devotional shrine of Lord Shiva) present here is believed to be the 12th jyotirlinga. The temple campus also has a well called Jnana Vapi or wisdom well. Many believe that the jyotirlinga was kept in the well to protect it and the main saint of the temple jumped into the well to keep it from intruders. The temple finds immense significance in Hindu mythology as many great saints from the religion are believed to have visited this site to get the darshan of the jyotirlinga and to bathe in the holy waters of the Ganga.</p><h2>Kal Bhairava Temple</h2><p>Kal Bhairav Temple, as is evident from the name, is dedicated to Lord Kal Bhairav, the fiercest form of Lord Shiva. The main idol in the temple features a man wearing a garland with a skull for a face. A popular belief here is that Kal Bhairava decides who stays in Varanasi, and perhaps that is why those coming to the city, first visit the temple, and those leaving stop here to take the god's permission. The entrance to the temple is narrow and one can see the deity from it. Devotees like to offer sesame oil and flowers to the deity. The inner sanctum has a back entrance but only priests can access it. There are many shops lined outside the premises in case visitors need to buy offerings for the god.</p><h2>Durga Mandir</h2><p>known as Monkey Temple due to the presence of a number of monkeys there. Within the compound is a kund (pond), lined by stone stairs on all sides and watch-pillars standing at each corner.  The temple is an important pilgrimage site for Hindu devotees, especially during Navaratri (a Hindu festival during which the goddess is worshipped). Among the devotees, there is a popular belief that the idol of Goddess Durga came into being on its own, and the red hues of the temple are a tribute to the goddess who is associated with the colour. Many believe that the goddess protects devotees from problems.</p><p>There is another famous Durga temple in Varanasi that goes by the name of Brahmacharini Durga Temple. It is located close to the Durga Ghat (means Durga Kund) at the bank of Ganga.</p><h2>Tulsi Manas Mandir</h2><p>Paying homage to the 6th-century Indian bhakti poet Goswami Tulsidas, the author of the epic Ramcharitramanas, the Tulsi Manas Mandir was constructed in 1964. Made with white marble, the temple is beautifully landscaped and has verses and scenes from the Ramcharitramanas engraved on its walls. Located close to the Banaras Hindu University, it has a lot of historic and cultural importance primarily because Goswami Tulsidas is credited with popularising the Indian epic Ramayan, by writing it in Awadhi, a dialect of the Hindi language, thereby making it accessible to the masses. The temple is dedicated to Lord Rama and lies in close proximity to the famous Durga temple. It houses beautiful idols of Lord Rama, Goddess Sita, Lord Lakshmana and Lord Hanuman. It also has a lovely garden.</p><h2>Parshavnath Jain Temple</h2><p>Dedicated to the 23rd tirthankara (saint) of the Jain religion, Parshavnath, the Parshavnath Jain Temple is located away from the city centre, at Bhelapur. Primarily managed by the Digambara sect of Jainism, the temple is a prominent pilgrimage centre for members of the Jain community. It is believed to date back to the time of Bhagawan Adinath. It is said that that the svayamvar of the daughter of the king of Kashi, Sulochana, was held here. The tirth also finds mention in Vividh Tirth Kalpa, which was written by Acharya Jinaprabhsurisvarji, a scholar, in the 14th century. The lattice work of the temple is delicate and intricate and the carvings along the walls of the structure add to its value.</p>","slug":"/articles/varanasi","componentName":"article","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.618Z","image":{"name":"the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi-new","alternativeText":"the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi-new","caption":"the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi-new","width":388,"height":300,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi-new","hash":"thumbnail_the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi_new_cbc507c981","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":202,"height":156,"size":11.49,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi_new_cbc507c981.jpg"}},"hash":"the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi_new_cbc507c981","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":33.76,"url":"/uploads/the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi_new_cbc507c981.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.429Z"},"seo":{"title":"The most popular attractions in Varanasi-new","description":"The most popular attractions in Varanasi","canonical":"/articles/varanasi","metaTags":[{"type":"Property","key":"og:title","value":"The most popular attractions in Varanasi-new"},{"type":"Property","key":"og:description","value":"The most popular attractions in Varanasi-new"}],"redirectRoutes":[]},"categories":[{"name":"Spiritual","slug":"/categories/spiritual","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.029Z"}],"author":{"name":"Deepika Mukherjee","info":"Traveller","slug":"/authors/deepika-mukherjee","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.233Z","picture":{"name":"deepikamukherjee","alternativeText":"deepikamukherjee","caption":"deepikamukherjee","width":50,"height":50,"hash":"deepikamukherjee_a29575b3c3","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":1,"url":"/uploads/deepikamukherjee_a29575b3c3.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.185Z"}}},{"title":"Kedarnath","content":"<p>Ensconced in the snow-capped Garhwal Himalayas, surrounded by a lush cover of alpine meadows and brushed by the pristine and holy Mandakini river, Kedarnath is a prominent pilgrimage spot. One of the char dhams, which are considered important pilgrimage destinations by Hindus, Kedarnath is said to be the abode of Lord Shiva, who is worshipped in the main shrine. Thousands of devotees from all over the country, undertake an arduous but devotional journey to reach this 3,584-m-high temple, which is the highest of the 12 jyotirlingas (devotional shrines of Lord Shiva) in India.</p><p>Crystal clear lakes, curative hot springs and colourful valley beds of rhododendrons, make Kedarnath a nature lover's delight. For those who want to hike their way into the heart of the Himalayas, there are trekking options galore. The most popular of these is the trek from the sacred Gaurikund to the temple and from the temple to the serene Vasuki Lake.</p><h2>Chorabari Tal</h2><p>The crystal-clear Chorabari Tal offers magnificent views of the surrounding Himalayan peaks. Also known as the Gandhi Sarovar or Gandhi Tal, the lake lies about 3 km from the Kedarnath temple. An easy trek from the temple leads you to the lake, which was originally known as Kanti Sarovar. In 1948, some of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were immersed in the lake after which it was renamed Gandhi Sarovar. Legend has it that it was at Chorabari Lake that Lord Shiva imparted the knowledge of yoga to the Saptrishis. Perched at an altitude of 3,900 m above sea level, the lake originates from the Chorabari Bamak Glacier. You can also visit the nearby Bhairava Temple. The mesmeric Madhu Ganga Waterfalls falling on the way makes for a serene stopover.</p><h2>Shankaracharya Samadhi</h2><p>Lying slightly behind the Kedarnath Temple is the grave of Adi guru Shankaracharya, the saint who is said to have established the four sacred dhams in India that are an important pilgrimage for Hindus. The famous Hindu philosopher had attained nirvana (enlightenment) at a young age of 32. It is said that Shakaracharya merged with the land itself. Visited by thousands of pilgrims, the Shankaracharya Samadhi is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Kedarnath. Legend has it that Shankaracharya came to Kedarnath in the 8th century and built the Kedarnath shrine and established one of his four mathas. A hot water spring believed to have been created by Shankaracharya is visited by his disciples to get relief from the extreme climatic conditions in the area.</p><h2>Gaurikund</h2><p>The hot water spring of Gaurikund is one of the holiest sites for Hindus, who come to take a dip in it. It is believed that taking a dip in the holy water of the pond will make a person pure. Surrounded by panoramic views, Gaurikund also serves as the starting point of the famous Kedarnath temple trek. The spring lies at a height of about 6,000 ft in the Garhwal Himalayas. Devotees also visit the Gauri Devi Temple dedicated to Goddess Parvati. It is believed that this was the site where Goddess Parvati had meditated for a long time to win Lord Shiva as her husband. The area is also associated with the legend of Lord Ganesha acquiring his elephant head.</p>","slug":"/articles/kedarnath","componentName":"article","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.576Z","image":{"name":"kedarnath","alternativeText":"kedarnath","caption":"kedarnath","width":388,"height":300,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_kedarnath","hash":"thumbnail_kedarnath_173aa0a061","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":202,"height":156,"size":10.62,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_kedarnath_173aa0a061.jpg"}},"hash":"kedarnath_173aa0a061","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":34.93,"url":"/uploads/kedarnath_173aa0a061.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.417Z"},"seo":{"title":"Kedarnath - Abode of Lord Shiva","description":"Ensconced in the snow-capped Garhwal Himalayas, surrounded by a lush cover of alpine meadows and brushed by the pristine and holy Mandakini river,","canonical":"/articles/kedarnath","metaTags":[{"type":"Property","key":"og:title","value":"Kedarnath - Abode of Lord Shiva"},{"type":"Property","key":"og:description","value":"Ensconced in the snow-capped Garhwal Himalayas, surrounded by a lush cover of alpine meadows and brushed by the pristine and holy Mandakini river,"}],"redirectRoutes":[]},"categories":[{"name":"Spiritual","slug":"/categories/spiritual","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.029Z"}],"author":{"name":"Priya Sharma","info":"Traveller","slug":"/authors/priya-Sharma","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.208Z","picture":{"name":"priyasharma","alternativeText":"priyasharma","caption":"priyasharma","width":50,"height":50,"hash":"priyasharma_b2f1d624f4","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":1,"url":"/uploads/priyasharma_b2f1d624f4.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.171Z"}}}],"totalCount":2}
