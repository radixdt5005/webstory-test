It is  the home state of Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of the Nation. It is renowned for its beaches, temple towns and historic capitals. Wildlife sanctuaries, hill resorts and natural grandeur are gifts of Gujarat. Sculpture, handicrafts, arts, festivals also make the state rich. Gujarat is also among the most technologically advanced, housing the largest petrochemical complex in the country.</p><h2>Experiences In Gujarat</h2><h3>Kite Festival</h3><p>The International Kite Festival (Uttarayan) is regarded as one of the biggest festivals. Months before the festival, homes in Gujarat begin to manufacture kites.</p><p>During the festival, local food such as Undhiyu (a mixed vegetable including yam and beans), sesame seed brittle and jalebi is served to the crowds. Days before the festival, the market is filled with participants buying their supplies. In 2012, the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat mentioned that the International Kite Festival in Gujarat was attempting to enter the Guinness World Records book due to the participation of 42 countries in it that year. The best place to enjoy this festival is the Sabarmati Riverfront or the Ahmedabad Police Stadium, where people lie down to see the sky filled with thousands of kites.</p><h3>Navratri</h3><p>Navratri, meaning 'nine nights', is one of the most popular and widely celebrated Hindu festivals in many parts of India. Gujarat, however, is the only state that erupts into a nine-night dance festival, perhaps the longest in the world. Each night, all over the state, villages and cities alike, people gather in open spaces to celebrate feminine divinity, referred to as Shakti.</p><p>The dance form known as ras garba (also joined sometimes by dandiya, which uses small wooden sticks), comes from Lord Krishna's worship rather than Goddess worship, from the Gop culture of Saurashtra and Kutch.</p><h2>Things To Do In Gujarat</h2><ul><li>Cuisine</li><li>Tourist Attractions</li><li>Culture</li><li>Flora And Fauna</li></ul><h2>UNESCO World Heritage Sites</h2><h3>Rani Ki Vav, Patan</h3><p>The stepwell was built in 1063 by Rani Udayamati of the Chaulukya Dynasty to commemorate her husband, Bhimdev I. The stepwell was rediscovered in 1940s, and the Archeological Survey of India restored it in the 1980s.</p><h3>Champaner and Pavagadh Archaeological Park</h3><p>A UNESCO Heritage site, Champaner and Pavagadh, are often clubbed together as one of the most engaging historical attractions of Gujarat. The duo makes a rich heritage site dotted with forts, mosques, monuments, tombs, arches, temples, step-wells and fortresses from 8th to 14th centuries.</p><h3>Ahmedabad World Heritage City</h3><p>Situated in the heart of Gujarat, Ahmedabad has a character like no other, defined by a spirit of enterprise. Although Ahmedabad is a bustling metropolitan with reputed institutes and a rapidly growing economy, it is deeply rooted in tradition. The city is known for its association with Mahatma Gandhi, and in addition to a complex maze of neighborhood called pols, hosts some of the country’s finest medieval Islamic Architecture.</p><h2>Top Attractions &amp; Destinations In Gujarat</h2><h3>RannUtsav</h3><p>A plethora of varied hues, profusion of design, superfluity of culture, cornucopia of music and dance, all together in the arid lands of Kutch create a mosaic of exquisiteness, which reflects the identity and spirit of the region. Kutch, one of the most ecologically and ethnically diverse districts of the state is a celebratory land of art, crafts, music, dance, people, and nature. During the full moon night of winters, amid the awe-inspiring and contrasting landscape, each year a three-day festive extravaganza brimming with hospitality, vigor and traditional flavor of the area is hosted and known as the Kutch of Rannutsav.</p><h3>Sasan Gir</h3><p>This forested, hilly, 1412-sq-km sanctuary, about halfway between Veraval and Junagadh, is the last refuge of the Asiatic lion (Panthera leopersica).

Access to the sanctuary is by safari permit only, bookable in advance online.</p><h3>Statue Of Unity</h3><p>October 31st, 2018, marked the inauguration of the world’s tallest statue – the Statue of Unity, against the backdrop of the dramatic Satpura and Vindhyachal hills in Kevadia, Gujarat. The 182-metre (600 feet approx.) statue is dedicated to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the architect of independent India. The colossal monument towers over River Narmada, a tribute to India ‘from the people of Gujarat’ to the leader who placed people’s welfare first. The Statue of Unity overlooks a vast area, including the river basin of the Narmada and the sprawling Sardar Sarovar dam.</p>","slug":"/articles/gujarat","componentName":"article","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.833Z","image":{"name":"khushboo_gujarat_ki","alternativeText":"khushboo_gujarat_ki","caption":"khushboo_gujarat_ki","width":1397,"height":1079,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_khushboo_gujarat_ki","hash":"thumbnail_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":202,"height":156,"size":12.69,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_khushboo_gujarat_ki","hash":"small_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":386,"size":79.07,"url":"/uploads/small_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_khushboo_gujarat_ki","hash":"medium_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":579,"size":165.85,"url":"/uploads/medium_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_khushboo_gujarat_ki","hash":"large_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":772,"size":264.92,"url":"/uploads/large_khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb.jpg"}},"hash":"khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":369.29,"url":"/uploads/khushboo_gujarat_ki_f150ef35eb.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.812Z"},"seo":{"title":"Khushboo Gujarat Ki","description":"Vibrant Gujarat stretches out into the Arabian Sea, with a hint of the desert and a coastline of 1600 km.","canonical":"/articles/gujarat","metaTags":[{"type":"Property","key":"og:title","value":"Khushboo Gujarat Ki"},{"type":"Property","key":"og:description","value":"Vibrant Gujarat stretches out into the Arabian Sea, with a hint of the desert and a coastline of 1600 km."}],"redirectRoutes":[]},"categories":[{"name":"Heritage","slug":"/categories/heritage","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.029Z"}],"author":{"name":"Jigar Verma","info":"Traveller","slug":"/authors/jigar-verma","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.201Z","picture":{"name":"jigarverma","alternativeText":"jigarverma","caption":"jigarverma","width":50,"height":50,"hash":"jigarverma_62c6b21c20","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":0.98,"url":"/uploads/jigarverma_62c6b21c20.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.159Z"}}},{"title":"Adventure Sports In Ladakh","content":"<p>The stark and pristine landscape of Ladakh, bound by rugged mountains, deep gorges and harsh terrain is ideal for adventure sports like trekking, mountain climbing, camping, etc. Moreover, the gurgling Indus and Zanskar rivers cutting through the scenery provide perfect backdrops for adventure in the water.</p><p><strong>Mountain Biking</strong></p><p>There are several mountain biking trails across Leh-Ladakh. Adventure seekers can bike on Khardung La, which is considered to be among the highest motorable roads in the world, along the shores of Pangong Lake, through the Warila pass, in the Nubra Valley, and by the banks of rivers Indus and Zanskar. Several tour companies organise day-long or multiple-day biking tours for individuals and groups. Along the way, bikers are treated to local cultures, homestays and food. Since this is a strenuous activity, bikers must make sure they are fully acclimatised and in good shape before they embark on this adventure. Mountain biking is a great way to see the Leh-Ladakh region for those who like to ride and are up for the adventure in the mountains. Some companies may need visitors to prove they are fit for the adventure with short exercises or fitness certificates. The tours vary in their levels of difficulty.</p><p><strong>Chadar Trek</strong></p><p>Chadar Trek can only be enjoyed during the winter months in Ladakh. It gets its name from the fact that, during winter, the rivers freeze and form a blanket of ice that forms the main terrain of this trek. Throughout the adventure, trekkers are walking on precarious icy formations, staying in caves filled with stalactites and stalagmites and encountering other snowy landscape. It is very important to have an experienced guide who leads the trek. The trek covers a distance of approximately 62 km, which takes about nine days to cover and scales a height of up to 11,000 ft. The trek is mostly covered on the frozen River Zanskar and begins from the village of Chilling. February is considered to be the best time to complete this trek as the ice is most stable during that month.</p><p><strong>River Rafting</strong></p><p>Due to the presence of two prominent rivers—the Indus and the Zanskar—Ladakh offers amazing river rafting opportunities to thrill-lovers. The Zanskar river features one of the best gorges for navigation in the world. Whitewater rapids are found in abundance as rafters head down the river and witness spectacular geological formations all around. There is also the chance to enjoy the hospitality of the Zanskari people. There are various tours that can feature a rafting distance of 5 km to almost 30 km. Even shorter rafting tours can be organised for a few hours. Some of the places that feature on these rafting routes include Tsogsti, Nimoo, Scorpoche, and Chilling. This adventure activity is best enjoyed in groups.</p><p><strong>Trekking</strong></p><p>Leh-Ladakh’s diverse terrain includes mountains, valleys and rivers, making it a haven for trekking enthusiasts. These treks navigate through remote villages and pristine locations, offering a peek into the life of villagers. Some of these treks may last for a few hours or a few days. Some popular routes include Lamayuru to Alchi trek, Ripchar Valley trek, Padum to Darcha trek, Lamayuru to Stok Kangri trek, Markha Valley trek, Jhulum Hemis trek and the famous Chadar trek. The Chadar Trek can only be enjoyed during the winter months in Ladakh.</p><p><strong>Bactrian Camel Ride</strong></p><p>A prominent location on the ancient Silk Route, Nubra Valley, in Ladakh, is home to two-humped Bactrian camels, who were brought to the region from Central Asia. Today, these camels are the remnants of this glorious trading past and offer enjoyable rides around the sand dunes of Hunder in Nubra Valley. This experience can also be enjoyed at Agling, which is a Tibetan village close to Leh. The camel ride takes visitors to Stok and this journey takes about four hours to complete. Along the way, the terrain changes from lush greenery to a desert. Riding on the back of a camel is one of the most thrilling ways to explore this high altitude cold desert. Perched at an elevation of about 10,000 ft, Hunder is bordered by snow-clad mountains that present a picturesque backdrop to the arid but mesmerising landscape.</p><p><strong>Mountain Climbing</strong></p><p>Since the region of Leh-Ladakh is blessed with the towering Himalayas and Karakoram ranges, it offers mountain climbers plenty of options to choose from. The most popular mountains for this activity are Stok Kangri, Kang Yatse, Mentok Kangri, Chamsher, and Lingser Kangri. Most of these aren’t tough to climb. However, climbers need to possess excellent skills. They must also ensure that they are fully acclimatised to the weather to prevent any breathlessness or Acute Mountain Sickness. Leh-Ladakh is one of the few places in the world where mountain climbers can scale a height of 6,000 m within a week or more. These expeditions take climbers through surreal terrains where they can encounter fauna like blue sheep and birds. On the way, pristine lakes and the unique cultures of the nomadic Changpa people can also be experienced.</p><p><strong>Trekking in Markha Valley</strong></p><p>The best season to embark on the Markha Valley trek is from June to September. It scales a height of approximately 3,700 m above sea level and takes about eight days to complete. There are mesmeric sights and experiences to be enjoyed along the route. Trekking along the Markha river will bring you to the village of Nimaling, where you can witness the tall peak of Kangyatse. Other peaks that can be viewed along the route include Saser Kangri, Stok Kangri, and Nun Kun. The most delightful part of this trekking route has got to be when it makes its way through the Hemis National Park. This place is unlike any other park and is famed for creatures like snow leopards, ibexes and blue sheep. Wildlife enthusiasts must not miss out on this trek. Being properly acclimatised is important before embarking on this adventure. It is best to complete the trek in a group with a professional guide.</p><p><strong>Camping</strong></p><p>Camping in Ladakh is one of the most amazing experiences. Be it on the side of crystal-clear lakes, near Buddhist monasteries or gorgeous locations amidst a stark scenery, camping in Ladakh is must-try. Camps here feature semi-luxurious and luxurious tents with bathrooms, warm bedding and other amenities. They also have a central dining room. Camp Martsemik La, Wonderland Camp and Camp Watermark are the popular camps near Pangong Lake. The Mystique Meadows Camp, Valley Flower Camp and Double Humped Camp Hunder are some of the popular spots in Nubra Valley. The Chamba Camp at Thiksey is one of the most luxurious camps in India. The camps vary in their costs: some are great for backpackers, other are mid-budget while the rest are luxurious. The camps usually help guests chart out itineraries, organise local tours and also set up bonfires and other activities within the premises.</p>","slug":"/articles/adventure-sports","componentName":"article","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:14:02.865Z","image":{"name":"adventure_sports_in_ladakh","alternativeText":"adventure_sports_in_ladakh","caption":"adventure_sports_in_ladakh","width":388,"height":300,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_adventure_sports_in_ladakh","hash":"thumbnail_adventure_sports_in_ladakh_ce840f0003","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":202,"height":156,"size":12.74,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_adventure_sports_in_ladakh_ce840f0003.jpg"}},"hash":"adventure_sports_in_ladakh_ce840f0003","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":44.7,"url":"/uploads/adventure_sports_in_ladakh_ce840f0003.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.413Z"},"seo":{"title":"Adventure Sports In Ladakh","description":"The stark and pristine landscape of Ladakh, bound by rugged mountains,","canonical":"/articles/adventure-sports","metaTags":[{"type":"Property","key":"og:title","value":"Adventure Sports In Ladakh"},{"type":"Property","key":"og:description","value":"The stark and pristine landscape of Ladakh, bound by rugged mountains,"}],"redirectRoutes":[]},"categories":[{"name":"Adventure","slug":"/categories/adventure","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.029Z"},{"name":"Nature And Wildlife","slug":"/categories/nature-and-wildlife","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.029Z"}],"author":{"name":"Avinash Shah","info":"Traveller","slug":"/authors/avinash-shah","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.194Z","picture":{"name":"avinashshah","alternativeText":"avinashshah","caption":"avinashshah","width":50,"height":50,"hash":"avinashshah_8a8fef95b2","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":0.98,"url":"/uploads/avinashshah_8a8fef95b2.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.166Z"}}},{"title":"Most Popular Heritage","content":"<p>Among the seven wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal, in Agra, is a delight to explore.

It has also been described as a “teardrop on the cheek of eternity” by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Every year, thousands of tourists from around the world make a beeline for this breathtakingly ethereal marble monument, considerd by many as the most beautiful building constructed by man. The monument was built as a memorial by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his deceased wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is one of the seven wonders of the world and is a monument of pride for not just Agra but also India.</p><p>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is featured in almost all literature about India and is one of the most enduring images of the country. Its name is believed to have been drawn from the Persian language: ‘taj’ means crown and ‘mahal’ means palace, thus making this the palace of the crown. Interestingly, the queen it was built in memory of, originally named Arjumand Begum, held the name Mumtaz Mahal, which meant the crown of the palace. Although it is best known as a symbol of love, a grieving emperor’s ode to his deceased queen, another legend sees the Taj Mahal as an embodiment of Shah Jahan’s vision of kingship. The story goes that he sought to build something akin to heaven on earth, a spectacular, unbelievably beautiful monument that reinforced the power as well as the perceived divinity of the monarch as next only to the Almighty.</p><p>It is also widely believed that emperor Shah Jahan invited artisans from Italy and Persia to work on this marble monument. It is said that Ustad Ahmad Lahori was the chief of the project while Ustad Isa Afandi made the site plan. The calligraphic work has been credited to Amanat Ali Khan Shirazi. A fascinating aspect of this structure is that it looks the same from all four sides, except the one that faces River Yamuna. This side is said to have been especially embellished to serve as the main entrance for the emperor. Shah Jahan would approach the Taj Mahal from the river, aboard a barge, while the entrance used by tourists today served, at the time, as an entryway for soldiers and common people. There are intricate inscriptions on all four entrances, while marble carvings and pietra dura mosaics adorn the walls. Lapis-lazuli, cornelian, mother of pearl, agate and emerald are some of the precious gems and stones that were once used in its design. It is said that work on its construction began in 1631.

From classical and traditional to folk and tribal, there are various dance forms in India. The most popularly recognised classical dance forms are eight, which find themselves steeped in a rich mythological and religious history and have been mentioned in the ancient Hindu text of Natya Shastra. These are Bharat Natyam (Tamil Nadu), Sattriya (Assam), Manipuri (Manipur), Kathak (northern and western India), Odissi (Odisha), Kuchipudi (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), Kathakali (Kerala), Mohiniyattam (Kerala).</p><p>Read More</p><h2>Bharat Natyam</h2><p>Considered to be the oldest dance and an inspiration to all other styles, Bharat Natyam, a temple dance of Tamil Nadu, is an enchanting performance that relates scenes from religious texts and myths. In a series of quick and complicated neat motions, dancers dressed in vibrant attires and ornamented heavily from head to toe, execute moves that are a sight to behold. The continuously varying tempo and the stunning synchronisation of the dancers is a breathtaking sight.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.incredibleindia.org/content/dam/incredible-india-v2/images/experiences/art/bharatnatyam-dance/bharatnatyam-dance.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1800.737.jpeg\" alt=\"undefined\" title=\"Bharat Natyam\" loading=\"lazy\"></p><h2>Sattriya</h2><p>A dance-drama performance, native to Assam, Sattriya dance was created in the 15th century and has been a living tradition since. A regale of religious sagas, it is generally performed in monasteries, where the dancers dressed in stunning pat silks and adorned with traditional Assamese jewellery weave magic to the beats of cymbals, drums, flutes and even harmonium and violin.</p><h2>Manipuri</h2><p>Manipuri dance, originating from the state of Manipur, is a spiritual experience that transcends art and seems more like a divine dance. Mostly revolving around Goddess Radha and Lord Krishna, this soft, mild and modest dance form sees dancers execute graceful and delicate movements to lyrical undertones. While the women are clad in a wrap-around skirt called sarong, the men wear a dhoti and a turban.</p><h2>Kathak</h2><p>Said to have introduced by the bards travelling around the regions of north India, Kathak involves the recounting of religious tales and legends in a rhythmic fashion. From tapping of feet and hand gestures to eye movements and facial expressions, Kathak leaves one reeling with wonder at the finesse and skill of the dancers clad in a long embroidered skirt, complemented with a choli (blouse) and chunni (a long scarf).</p><h2>Odissi</h2><p>Dancers dressed in brightly coloured silk sarees, decked in silver jewellery and musical anklets (ghungroo), perform Odissi, which originated in Odisha. A dance illustrating mythical stories and legends, Odissi involves the use of impressive body movements and excellent expressions.</p><h2>Kuchipudi</h2><p>Largely featuring scenes and stories from the life of Lord Krishna, Kuchipudi, from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, is essentially a temple dance. While a female dancer wears a pleated sari that opens like a hand fan, a male dancer is clad in a dhoti. The dancers are adorned with traditional jewellery and dance to the rhythmic beats of cymbals, flute, veena, tambura etc.</p><h2>Kathakali</h2><p>A classical dance-drama native to the state of Kerala, Kathakali is believed to be almost 300 years old. It recounts the tales of the past, from epics, legends and myths, and while the dance and music resound with devotion, what really awes is the striking make-up of the dancers. The participants are clad in elaborate attires and don vibrant hues of make-up. Every flicker of the eye, twirling of the fingers or the quivering of lips has a special significance.</p><h2>Mohiniyattam</h2><p>Mohiniyattam is a gentle, graceful and feminine form of dance that originated in the state of Kerala. The dance derives its name from the word 'Mohini', which means the female avatar of Lord Vishnu. Usually performed by a solo female dancer, the performance emotes a play through music and elegant movements. The song is generally a mix of Sanskrit and Malayalam languages.</p><h2>Dance Festivals</h2><p>There are hundreds of other folk dance forms which proliferate through the many cultures in the country and which are the life and soul of festivities across regions. The most exquisite way of experiencing these graceful evocations is through the many prestigious dance festivals</p>","slug":"/articles/dance-forms","componentName":"article","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.510Z","image":{"name":"dance_an_eloquent_form_of_expression","alternativeText":"dance_an_eloquent_form_of_expression","caption":"dance_an_eloquent_form_of_expression","width":388,"height":300,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_dance_an_eloquent_form_of_expression","hash":"thumbnail_dance_an_eloquent_form_of_expression_3b67651792","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":202,"height":156,"size":8.31,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_dance_an_eloquent_form_of_expression_3b67651792.jpg"}},"hash":"dance_an_eloquent_form_of_expression_3b67651792","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":25.69,"url":"/uploads/dance_an_eloquent_form_of_expression_3b67651792.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.408Z"},"seo":{"title":"Dance; an eloquent form of expression","description":"Dance; an eloquent form of expression","canonical":"/articles/dance-forms","metaTags":[{"type":"Property","key":"og:title","value":"Dance; an eloquent form of expression"},{"type":"Property","key":"og:description","value":"Dance; an eloquent form of expression"}],"redirectRoutes":[]},"categories":[{"name":"Art","slug":"/categories/art","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.029Z"}],"author":{"name":"Priya Sharma","info":"Traveller","slug":"/authors/priya-Sharma","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.208Z","picture":{"name":"priyasharma","alternativeText":"priyasharma","caption":"priyasharma","width":50,"height":50,"hash":"priyasharma_b2f1d624f4","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":1,"url":"/uploads/priyasharma_b2f1d624f4.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.171Z"}}},{"title":"Mountain Ranges","content":"<p>The Indian peninsula is home to many majestic and mighty mountain peaks and ranges.

Also referred to as the golden temple, due to its gold-plating, this temple holds a very special place among Hindu devotees. Given its present shape in 1780 by queen Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore, the temple's iconic 15.5-metre-high gold spire and gold dome were donated by Ranjeet Singh, the ruler of Punjab in 1839. The temple is ensconced within a maze of other shrines and narrow galis or walkways lined by shops selling sweetmeats, paan (betel leaf), handicrafts and other knick-knacks. The time for darshan (general visit) is from 4 am to 11 pm. Adjacent to the temple are Annapurna Temple dedicated to the goddess of food and Dundiraj Vinayak dedicated to Lord Ganesha, which are equally revered. The temple is located on the banks of River Ganges and the jyotirlinga (devotional shrine of Lord Shiva) present here is believed to be the 12th jyotirlinga. The temple campus also has a well called Jnana Vapi or wisdom well. Many believe that the jyotirlinga was kept in the well to protect it and the main saint of the temple jumped into the well to keep it from intruders. The temple finds immense significance in Hindu mythology as many great saints from the religion are believed to have visited this site to get the darshan of the jyotirlinga and to bathe in the holy waters of the Ganga.</p><h2>Kal Bhairava Temple</h2><p>Kal Bhairav Temple, as is evident from the name, is dedicated to Lord Kal Bhairav, the fiercest form of Lord Shiva. The main idol in the temple features a man wearing a garland with a skull for a face. A popular belief here is that Kal Bhairava decides who stays in Varanasi, and perhaps that is why those coming to the city, first visit the temple, and those leaving stop here to take the god's permission. The entrance to the temple is narrow and one can see the deity from it. Devotees like to offer sesame oil and flowers to the deity. The inner sanctum has a back entrance but only priests can access it. There are many shops lined outside the premises in case visitors need to buy offerings for the god.</p><h2>Durga Mandir</h2><p>known as Monkey Temple due to the presence of a number of monkeys there. Within the compound is a kund (pond), lined by stone stairs on all sides and watch-pillars standing at each corner.  The temple is an important pilgrimage site for Hindu devotees, especially during Navaratri (a Hindu festival during which the goddess is worshipped). Among the devotees, there is a popular belief that the idol of Goddess Durga came into being on its own, and the red hues of the temple are a tribute to the goddess who is associated with the colour. Many believe that the goddess protects devotees from problems.</p><p>There is another famous Durga temple in Varanasi that goes by the name of Brahmacharini Durga Temple. It is located close to the Durga Ghat (means Durga Kund) at the bank of Ganga.</p><h2>Tulsi Manas Mandir</h2><p>Paying homage to the 6th-century Indian bhakti poet Goswami Tulsidas, the author of the epic Ramcharitramanas, the Tulsi Manas Mandir was constructed in 1964. Made with white marble, the temple is beautifully landscaped and has verses and scenes from the Ramcharitramanas engraved on its walls. Located close to the Banaras Hindu University, it has a lot of historic and cultural importance primarily because Goswami Tulsidas is credited with popularising the Indian epic Ramayan, by writing it in Awadhi, a dialect of the Hindi language, thereby making it accessible to the masses. The temple is dedicated to Lord Rama and lies in close proximity to the famous Durga temple. It houses beautiful idols of Lord Rama, Goddess Sita, Lord Lakshmana and Lord Hanuman. It also has a lovely garden.</p><h2>Parshavnath Jain Temple</h2><p>Dedicated to the 23rd tirthankara (saint) of the Jain religion, Parshavnath, the Parshavnath Jain Temple is located away from the city centre, at Bhelapur. Primarily managed by the Digambara sect of Jainism, the temple is a prominent pilgrimage centre for members of the Jain community. It is believed to date back to the time of Bhagawan Adinath. It is said that that the svayamvar of the daughter of the king of Kashi, Sulochana, was held here. The tirth also finds mention in Vividh Tirth Kalpa, which was written by Acharya Jinaprabhsurisvarji, a scholar, in the 14th century. The lattice work of the temple is delicate and intricate and the carvings along the walls of the structure add to its value.</p>","slug":"/articles/varanasi","componentName":"article","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.618Z","image":{"name":"the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi-new","alternativeText":"the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi-new","caption":"the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi-new","width":388,"height":300,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi-new","hash":"thumbnail_the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi_new_cbc507c981","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":202,"height":156,"size":11.49,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi_new_cbc507c981.jpg"}},"hash":"the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi_new_cbc507c981","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":33.76,"url":"/uploads/the_most_popular_attractions_in_varanasi_new_cbc507c981.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:10.429Z"},"seo":{"title":"The most popular attractions in Varanasi-new","description":"The most popular attractions in Varanasi","canonical":"/articles/varanasi","metaTags":[{"type":"Property","key":"og:title","value":"The most popular attractions in Varanasi-new"},{"type":"Property","key":"og:description","value":"The most popular attractions in Varanasi-new"}],"redirectRoutes":[]},"categories":[{"name":"Spiritual","slug":"/categories/spiritual","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.029Z"}],"author":{"name":"Deepika Mukherjee","info":"Traveller","slug":"/authors/deepika-mukherjee","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.233Z","picture":{"name":"deepikamukherjee","alternativeText":"deepikamukherjee","caption":"deepikamukherjee","width":50,"height":50,"hash":"deepikamukherjee_a29575b3c3","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":1,"url":"/uploads/deepikamukherjee_a29575b3c3.jpg","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T08:02:09.185Z"}}},{"title":"Ooty","content":"<p>A quaint hill town, perched against the backdrop of Doddabetta (2,637 m), the highest peak in the Nilgiris, Ootacamund, in Tamil Nadu, is lined with traditional and colonial-style buildings, which make it the perfect fusion of the new and the old.

One of the char dhams, which are considered important pilgrimage destinations by Hindus, Kedarnath is said to be the abode of Lord Shiva, who is worshipped in the main shrine. Thousands of devotees from all over the country, undertake an arduous but devotional journey to reach this 3,584-m-high temple, which is the highest of the 12 jyotirlingas (devotional shrines of Lord Shiva) in India.</p><p>Crystal clear lakes, curative hot springs and colourful valley beds of rhododendrons, make Kedarnath a nature lover's delight.

Also known as the Gandhi Sarovar or Gandhi Tal, the lake lies about 3 km from the Kedarnath temple. An easy trek from the temple leads you to the lake, which was originally known as Kanti Sarovar. In 1948, some of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were immersed in the lake after which it was renamed Gandhi Sarovar. Legend has it that it was at Chorabari Lake that Lord Shiva imparted the knowledge of yoga to the Saptrishis.

Adventure seekers can bike on Khardung La, which is considered to be among the highest motorable roads in the world, along the shores of Pangong Lake, through the Warila pass, in the Nubra Valley, and by the banks of rivers Indus and Zanskar. Several tour companies organise day-long or multiple-day biking tours for individuals and groups. Along the way, bikers are treated to local cultures, homestays and food. Since this is a strenuous activity, bikers must make sure they are fully acclimatised and in good shape before they embark on this adventure. Mountain biking is a great way to see the Leh-Ladakh region for those who like to ride and are up for the adventure in the mountains. Some companies may need visitors to prove they are fit for the adventure with short exercises or fitness certificates. The tours vary in their levels of difficulty.</p><p><strong>Chadar Trek</strong></p><p>Chadar Trek can only be enjoyed during the winter months in Ladakh. It gets its name from the fact that, during winter, the rivers freeze and form a blanket of ice that forms the main terrain of this trek. Throughout the adventure, trekkers are walking on precarious icy formations, staying in caves filled with stalactites and stalagmites and encountering other snowy landscape. It is very important to have an experienced guide who leads the trek. The trek covers a distance of approximately 62 km, which takes about nine days to cover and scales a height of up to 11,000 ft. The trek is mostly covered on the frozen River Zanskar and begins from the village of Chilling. February is considered to be the best time to complete this trek as the ice is most stable during that month.</p><p><strong>River Rafting</strong></p><p>Due to the presence of two prominent rivers—the Indus and the Zanskar—Ladakh offers amazing river rafting opportunities to thrill-lovers. The Zanskar river features one of the best gorges for navigation in the world. Whitewater rapids are found in abundance as rafters head down the river and witness spectacular geological formations all around. There is also the chance to enjoy the hospitality of the Zanskari people. There are various tours that can feature a rafting distance of 5 km to almost 30 km. Even shorter rafting tours can be organised for a few hours. Some of the places that feature on these rafting routes include Tsogsti, Nimoo, Scorpoche, and Chilling. This adventure activity is best enjoyed in groups.</p><p><strong>Trekking</strong></p><p>Leh-Ladakh’s diverse terrain includes mountains, valleys and rivers, making it a haven for trekking enthusiasts. These treks navigate through remote villages and pristine locations, offering a peek into the life of villagers. Some of these treks may last for a few hours or a few days. Some popular routes include Lamayuru to Alchi trek, Ripchar Valley trek, Padum to Darcha trek, Lamayuru to Stok Kangri trek, Markha Valley trek, Jhulum Hemis trek and the famous Chadar trek. The Chadar Trek can only be enjoyed during the winter months in Ladakh.</p><p><strong>Bactrian Camel Ride</strong></p><p>A prominent location on the ancient Silk Route, Nubra Valley, in Ladakh, is home to two-humped Bactrian camels, who were brought to the region from Central Asia. Today, these camels are the remnants of this glorious trading past and offer enjoyable rides around the sand dunes of Hunder in Nubra Valley. This experience can also be enjoyed at Agling, which is a Tibetan village close to Leh. The camel ride takes visitors to Stok and this journey takes about four hours to complete. Along the way, the terrain changes from lush greenery to a desert. Riding on the back of a camel is one of the most thrilling ways to explore this high altitude cold desert. Perched at an elevation of about 10,000 ft, Hunder is bordered by snow-clad mountains that present a picturesque backdrop to the arid but mesmerising landscape.</p><p><strong>Mountain Climbing</strong></p><p>Since the region of Leh-Ladakh is blessed with the towering Himalayas and Karakoram ranges, it offers mountain climbers plenty of options to choose from. The most popular mountains for this activity are Stok Kangri, Kang Yatse, Mentok Kangri, Chamsher, and Lingser Kangri. Most of these aren’t tough to climb. However, climbers need to possess excellent skills. They must also ensure that they are fully acclimatised to the weather to prevent any breathlessness or Acute Mountain Sickness. Leh-Ladakh is one of the few places in the world where mountain climbers can scale a height of 6,000 m within a week or more. These expeditions take climbers through surreal terrains where they can encounter fauna like blue sheep and birds. On the way, pristine lakes and the unique cultures of the nomadic Changpa people can also be experienced.</p><p><strong>Trekking in Markha Valley</strong></p><p>The best season to embark on the Markha Valley trek is from June to September. It scales a height of approximately 3,700 m above sea level and takes about eight days to complete. There are mesmeric sights and experiences to be enjoyed along the route. Trekking along the Markha river will bring you to the village of Nimaling, where you can witness the tall peak of Kangyatse. Other peaks that can be viewed along the route include Saser Kangri, Stok Kangri, and Nun Kun. The most delightful part of this trekking route has got to be when it makes its way through the Hemis National Park. This place is unlike any other park and is famed for creatures like snow leopards, ibexes and blue sheep. Wildlife enthusiasts must not miss out on this trek. Being properly acclimatised is important before embarking on this adventure. It is best to complete the trek in a group with a professional guide.</p><p><strong>Camping</strong></p><p>Camping in Ladakh is one of the most amazing experiences. Be it on the side of crystal-clear lakes, near Buddhist monasteries or gorgeous locations amidst a stark scenery, camping in Ladakh is must-try.
