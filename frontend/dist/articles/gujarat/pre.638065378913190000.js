Gujarat is also among the most technologically advanced, housing the largest petrochemical complex in the country.</p><h2>Experiences In Gujarat</h2><h3>Kite Festival</h3><p>The International Kite Festival (Uttarayan) is regarded as one of the biggest festivals. Months before the festival, homes in Gujarat begin to manufacture kites.</p><p>During the festival, local food such as Undhiyu (a mixed vegetable including yam and beans), sesame seed brittle and jalebi is served to the crowds. Days before the festival, the market is filled with participants buying their supplies. In 2012, the Tourism Corporation of Gujarat mentioned that the International Kite Festival in Gujarat was attempting to enter the Guinness World Records book due to the participation of 42 countries in it that year. The best place to enjoy this festival is the Sabarmati Riverfront or the Ahmedabad Police Stadium, where people lie down to see the sky filled with thousands of kites.</p><h3>Navratri</h3><p>Navratri, meaning 'nine nights', is one of the most popular and widely celebrated Hindu festivals in many parts of India. Gujarat, however, is the only state that erupts into a nine-night dance festival, perhaps the longest in the world. Each night, all over the state, villages and cities alike, people gather in open spaces to celebrate feminine divinity, referred to as Shakti.</p><p>The dance form known as ras garba (also joined sometimes by dandiya, which uses small wooden sticks), comes from Lord Krishna's worship rather than Goddess worship, from the Gop culture of Saurashtra and Kutch.</p><h2>Things To Do In Gujarat</h2><ul><li>Cuisine</li><li>Tourist Attractions</li><li>Culture</li><li>Flora And Fauna</li></ul><h2>UNESCO World Heritage Sites</h2><h3>Rani Ki Vav, Patan</h3><p>The stepwell was built in 1063 by Rani Udayamati of the Chaulukya Dynasty to commemorate her husband, Bhimdev I.
